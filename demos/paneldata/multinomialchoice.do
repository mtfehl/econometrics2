********** DATA DESCRIPTION **********

* Data Set comes from :
* J. A. Herriges and C. L. Kling, 
* "Nonlinear Income Effects in Random Utility Models", 
* Review of Economics and Statistics, 81(1999): 62-72

* The data are given as a combined observation with data on all 4 choices.
* This will work for multinomial logit program.
* For conditional logit will need to make a new data set which has
* four separate entries for each observation as there are four alternatives. 

* Filename: NLDATA.ASC
* Format: Ascii
* Number of Observations: 1182
* Each observations appears over 3 lines with 4 variables per line 
* so 4 x 1182 = 4728 observations 
* Variable Number and Description
* 1	Recreation mode choice. = 1 if beach, = 2 if pier; = 3 if private boat; = 4 if charter
* 2	Price for chosen alternative
* 3	Catch rate for chosen alternative
* 4	= 1 if beach mode chosen; = 0 otherwise
* 5	= 1 if pier mode chosen; = 0 otherwise
* 6	= 1 if private boat mode chosen; = 0 otherwise
* 7	= 1 if charter boat mode chosen; = 0 otherwise
* 8	= price for beach mode
* 9	= price for pier mode
* 10	= price for private boat mode
* 11	= price for charter boat mode
* 12	= catch rate for beach mode
* 13	= catch rate for pier mode
* 14	= catch rate for private boat mode
* 15	= catch rate for charter boat mode
* 16	= monthly income

********** READ IN DATA and SUMMARIZE (Table 15.1, p.492) **********

* Method to read in depends on model used

/* Data are on fishing mode: 1 beach, 2 pier, 3 private boat, 4 charter
   Data come as one observation having data for all 4 modes.
   Both alternative specific and alternative invariant regresssors.

* Look at data by alternative

********** (1) MULTINOMIAL LOGIT: ALTERNATIVE-INVARIANT REGRESSOR *********

*** (1A) Estimate the model

* Data are already in form for mlogit

* The following gives MNL column of Table 15.2, p.493
mlogit mode ydiv1000, baseoutcome(1)

*** (1B) Calculate the marginal effects

quietly mlogit mode ydiv1000, baseoutcome(1)
* Predict by default gives the probabilities
predict p1 p2 p3 p4


* As check compare predicted to actual probabilities
summarize dbeach p1 dpier p2 dprivate p3 dcharter p4

* Quick way to compute marginal effects (or semi-elasticities dp/dlnx or elasticities) 
* is to use built-in Stata function whcih evaluates at sample mean
* dydx, eyex, dwex or eydx
mfx compute, dydx predict(outcome(1))  
mfx compute, dydx predict(outcome(2))
mfx compute, dydx predict(outcome(3))
mfx compute, dydx predict(outcome(4))

* Better is to evaluate marginal effect for each observation and average
* The following calculates marginal effects using noncalculus methods 
* by comparing the predicted probability before and after change in x
* Here consider small change of 0.0001 - then multiply by 10000
* So should be similar to using calculus methods.
replace ydiv1000 = ydiv1000 + 0.0001
predict p1new p2new p3new p4new
gen dp1dy = 10000*(p1new - p1)
gen dp2dy = 10000*(p2new - p2)
gen dp3dy = 10000*(p3new - p3)
gen dp4dy = 10000*(p4new - p4)


* The computed marginal effects follow. 
* These are close to those given in text page 494 (which were calculated using Limdep)
sum dp1dy dp2dy dp3dy dp4dy 

* Note that here these are similar to the earlier values at means
* This is because little variation in predicted probability across individuals here

* Note that there is a lot of variation in the marginal effects across individuals.
