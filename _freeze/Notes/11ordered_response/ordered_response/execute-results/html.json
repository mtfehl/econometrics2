We now look at the case where alternatives can be **ordered**, which then can be estimated with so-called *Ordered Response Models*.\n\n## Ordered Response Model\n\nTo understand the ordered response model, we first need to define a **Latent Variable Model**:\n\nWe assume a latent (unobserved) outcome variable $y_i^*$, which can be thought of as \"Happiness\" or \"Utility\":\n\n$$\ny_i^* = x_i'\\beta + u_i\n$$\n\n* **Note:** <u>No intercept is included in this specification</u>. This is because if a constant exists when we try to calculate $\\mathbb{P}[\\varepsilon_i \\leq \\alpha_m - x_i'\\beta]$, we cannot separately identify the constant (intercept) from the thresholds.\n\n* **Properties:**\n\n    * The observed values $y_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ are **not cardinal**.\n    * Magnitude is meaningless (e.g., the difference between 1 and 2 is not necessarily the same as the difference between 3 and 4).\n    * Linearity assumptions do not hold for the outcome categories.\n    \nThis explains why OLS fails in this case; OLS implicitly assumes equidistant thresholds; i.e., the distance between $y_i = 1 \\text{ & } y_i = 2$ is the exact same as the distance between $y_i = 2 \\text{ & } y_i = 3$. Applied to our latent variable model, the 'width' of a category is determined by the distance between thresholds $(\\text{e.g. } \\alpha_2 - \\alpha_1)$. Let's say that $y_i^*$ represents life satisfaction; the thresholds for life satisfaction likely assume a non-equal form resembling the following structure:\n\n|     |    |  | ||| | |    |      |\n$\\alpha_1$ $\\dots$ $\\alpha_m$\n\n### Define Thresholds\n\nThe observed variable $y_i$ is determined by where the latent variable $y_i^*$ falls relative to thresholds (cut-points) $\\alpha_m$:\n\n$$\ny_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } \\alpha_0 < y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_1 \\quad (\\text{Assumed } \\alpha_0 = -\\infty) \\\\\n2 & \\text{if } \\alpha_1 < y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_2 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\nm & \\text{if } \\alpha_{m-1} < y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_m \\quad (\\text{Assumed } \\alpha_m = +\\infty)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\n### Ordered Response Probabilities\n\nDeriving the probabilities for each outcome category conditional on $x_i$:\n\n#### 1. Probability of the Lowest Category\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{P}[y_i = 1 \\mid X_i] &= \\mathbb{P}[y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_1 \\mid X_i] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{P}[x_i'\\beta + u_i \\leq \\alpha_1 \\mid X_i] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{P}[u_i \\leq \\alpha_1 - x_i'\\beta \\mid X_i]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n* Now depends on the distribution assumed on $u_i$.\n* For example, if $u_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ (Standard Normal):\n\n$$\n= F_x(\\alpha_1 - x_i'\\beta)= \\Phi(\\alpha_1 - x_i'\\beta)\n$$\n\nWhich gives us the **Ordered Probit Model**\n\n* *Note:* If $u_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, we divide by sigma to normalize:\n\n$$\n\\Phi\\left[ \\frac{u_i}{\\sigma} \\leq \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\sigma} - x_i'\\frac{\\beta}{\\sigma} \\mid X_i \\right]\n$$\n\n#### 2. Probability of Intermediate Categories\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{P}[y_i = 2 \\mid x_i] &= \\mathbb{P}[\\alpha_1 < y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_2 \\mid X_i] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{P}[y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_2 \\mid X_i] - \\mathbb{P}[y_i^* \\leq \\alpha_1 \\mid X_i] \\\\\n&= \\Phi(\\alpha_2 - x_i'\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha_1 - x_i'\\beta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n#### 3. Probability of the Highest Category\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{P}[y_i = m \\mid X_i] &= \\mathbb{P}[y_i^* > \\alpha_{m-1} \\mid X_i] \\\\\n&= 1 - \\Phi(\\alpha_{m-1} - x_i'\\beta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### Estimation and Marginal Effects\n\n#### Log-Likelihood Function\n\nThe log-likelihood for an individual $i$, denoted $\\ell_i(\\alpha, \\beta)$, combines the probabilities using indicator functions $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell_i(\\alpha, \\beta) &= \\mathbf{1}[y_i=1] \\log \\Phi(\\alpha_1 - x_i'\\beta) \\\\\n&+ \\mathbf{1}[y_i=2] \\log [\\Phi(\\alpha_2 - x_i'\\beta) - \\Phi(\\alpha_1 - x_i'\\beta)] \\\\\n&   \\dots \\\\\n& + \\mathbf{1}[y_i=m] \\log \\Phi(\\alpha_{m-1} - x_i'\\beta)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$\\Rightarrow$ MLE yields estimates $\\hat{\\beta}, \\hat{\\alpha}$.\n\n##### Feature: Parsimonious Model\n\nAn advantage of such models is that they are *parsimonious*: they only require $K + (m-1)$ coefficient estimates $(\\# \\beta + \\# \\alpha)$. Compare this to multinomial logit, which requires: $(K+1) \\cdot (m-1)$ coefficient estimates.\n\nTo see this, consider the following example:\n\nImagine predicting travel mode choice based on **Income**.\n\n  * **Ordered (Low, Med, High Quality):** Higher income pushes you up the quality ladder uniformly. <u>We need just one slope estimate</u> for \"Income\" and cut-points for \"Low/Med\" and \"Med/High\".\n  * **Multinomial (Bus, Bike, Car):** Higher income might make you *more* likely to drive a Car but *less* likely to Bike. The effect of income is fundamentally different for each outcome, so we need <u>to estimate separate slope parameters for each alternative</u>.\n\n#### Marginal Effects\n\nWe are interested in the impact of a change in regressor $x_i$ on the probability of choosing alternative $j$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{P}[y_i=j \\mid x_i]}{\\partial x_i}\n$$\n\nUsing the Chain Rule on the probability definitions (where $F' = f$, the PDF):\n\n$$\n= \\left[ F'(\\alpha_{j-1} - x_i'\\beta) - F'(\\alpha_j - x_i'\\beta) \\right] \\beta\n$$\n\n* Where $F$ corresponds to the CDF ($\\Phi$ for Probit, $\\Lambda$ for Logit).\n* The term in brackets determines the sign of the effect (can be $>0$ or $<0$).\n* However, the sign is **ambiguous**: we cannot use the sign of $\\beta$ to interpret the sign of the marginal effect. \n\n\n\n# Applied: Stata\n\n```{stata ordered probit}\n# oprobit depvar [indepvars]\n```\n\n",
